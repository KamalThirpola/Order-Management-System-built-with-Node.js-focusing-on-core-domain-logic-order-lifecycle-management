# Order Management System

An Order Management System developed using **Node.js** (NestJS preferred / Express acceptable) that manages order creation, lifecycle transitions, and business rules with a strong focus on core domain logic.

The system uses in-memory or file-based persistence and avoids external services to keep the design simple and logic-driven.
